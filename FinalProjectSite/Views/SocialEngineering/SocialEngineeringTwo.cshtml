<h2><u>A more in depth look at Social Engineering</u></h2>
<p>Here we will look more in depth Social Engineering in general, why it's so effective and a high profile case of an attack. As well as explaining the life cycle of Social Engineering.</p>

        Social Engineering is effective because the techniques used are based on certain attributes of human decision making which are known as Cognitive Biases.Cherry (2020) gives the definition of a cognitive bias stating that "A cognitive bias is a systematic error in thinking that affects the decisions and judgments that people make." Cognitive Bias is a flaw all humans share and this is what Social Engineering attacks exploit. Cognitive Bias occurs as a result of your brain's attempt to simplify information processing. There are different types of cognitive bias's such as: Confirmation Bias, Anchoring Bias and The Dunning-Kruger Effect. There is a lot of information online about these Biases and how they effect the mind but that is beyond the scope of this module, all we need to know is that attackers commonly create attacks which exploit these biases so they can get the Data or disruption that they want.
        To be successful Social Engineering relies on six principles of influence established by Robert Cialdini.

    <h3><u>The Six Principles</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reciprocity</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Commitment and Consistency</li>
        <li>Social Proof</li>
        <li>Authority</li>
        <li>Liking</li>
        <li>Scarcity</li>
    </ul>
