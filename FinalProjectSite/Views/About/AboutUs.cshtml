        <p class="lead">Online Security Solutions was created by George Brackpool in order to help provide guidance to the public, businesses and their employee's about various areas of cybersecurity. Whilst there are only a few module's at this point in time, more will be added in the future. Online Security is constantly changing due to technological development's, new software and new threats. Online threats are created or planned every day in an attempt for malicious individuals to collect and steal data for monetary or political reasons.</p>

            A majority of people in the world are aware of how important security online is and typically are very good with basic measures to keep their data secure. For example, having a secure password with a mixture of capital letter's number's and a symbol. Using Face ID or fingerprint scanner's on their phone's. However there are some more subtle threats that most are not aware of and a good example which you can find here on this site is Social Engineering. On Online Security Solutions we will teach you
            how to be safe and secure yourself in and out of the workplace.
